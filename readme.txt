This contains the repo for code for generating and analyzing steady-state VEP data in flies (and other animals)
It has grown out of a collaboration between Chris Elliot and Alex Wade at the University of York
Originally we used LEDs driven by NI boxes and custom amps (see Afsari et al HMG 2014). Later we used
a variety of display devices including LCDs. Finally Chris started building real hardware with LEDs and even
LCDs based on Arduinos and RPis. These are self-contained systems that include displays and amps and even
webservers to communicate with.

 This codebase contains all the software for all of these things.
