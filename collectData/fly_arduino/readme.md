## Some things I am learning about this code:

1: You can install libraries directly from the Arduino IDE. Or else they
are already present. For example SPI is present, SD is available from the interface.

2: Install radix4 by a) zipping the directory and b) using the IDE to install from the zip file

3: due.h (for the 'webserver') version is not present. It might be that this just needs a duexx 1 defined. I've insserted a sample for now..

4: The webserver does compile! I have not yet uploaded it. (19/10/23). I will need to jigger about with the ethernetaddress on my macbook to get it working I think - or plug into the router and hope it gets an IP address...
